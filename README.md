# Boston_Prices
Used Random forest model to predict hosuing prices based on boston housing prices dataset
# Boston House Price Predictor

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Boston based on various features. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [Boston Housing], which contains information about different aspects of houses in Boston.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `boston.joblib`: This is a pre-trained machine learning model saved using the joblib library. It can be loaded and used for making predictions.
- `boston_price_predictor.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file provides a step-by-step guide on how to train a machine learning model using the Boston Housing Dataset and how to use the model for predictions.
- `bostondata.csv`: This CSV file contains the Boston Housing Dataset.
- `model_usage.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file demonstrates how to load the pre-trained model and use it to make predictions on new data.
- `models.txt`: This text document provides output of all regression models.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
